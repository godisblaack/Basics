    If the above command doesn't work use:
    * `nmcli device wifi connect "<netwrokName>" --ask`

**7. Post-Installation Configuration and Desktop Environment Setup:**

* **Updating the System:**
    * After logging in, it's crucial to update your system to ensure you have the latest packages.
    * Run the following command:
        * `sudo pacman -Syy`
        * **Explanation:**
            * `sudo` grants administrative privileges.
            * `pacman` is the Arch Linux package manager.
            * `-Syy` forces a full database download from the mirrors and updates all installed packages.
* **Installing Text Editors:**
    * Install text editors for configuration and general use.
    * Run the following command:
        * `sudo pacman -S nano vim`
        * **Explanation:**
            * `nano` is a simple, user-friendly text editor.
            * `vim` is a powerful, highly configurable text editor.
* **Installing Essential X Window System and Window Manager Components:**
    * To have a graphical user interface, you'll need the X Window System and a window manager.
    * Run the following commands:
        * `sudo pacman -S xterm`
            * **Explanation:** Installs xterm, a terminal emulator for the X Window System.
        * `sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit`
            * **Explanation:** Installs the Xorg server (the display server) and xinit (a program to start the X server).
        * `sudo pacman -S openbox i3-wm i3status`
            * **Explanation:** Installs Openbox (a light weight window manager), i3-wm (a tiling window manager), and i3status (a status bar for i3).
* **Configuring i3 Window Manager:**
    * Configure i3 to start xterm when you press the mod key (usually the Windows key) and Enter.
    * Edit the `~/.xinitrc` file:
        * `nano ~/.xinitrc`
        * Add the following line:
            * `exec i3`
        * Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).
        * **Explanation:** This line tells xinit to start i3 when the X server starts.
    * Configure i3 to open xterm with the mod+Enter keybind.
        * `nano ~/.config/i3/config`
        * Find the line that starts with `bindsym $mod+Return exec <i3_something>` and change the command to `xterm`. It should look like this:
            * `bindsym $mod+Return exec xterm`
        * save and exit.
    * Set xterm as your default terminal.
        * `nano ~/.bashrc`
        * Add the following line:
            * `export TERMINAL=/usr/bin/xterm`
        * Save and exit.
        * Run the command to apply the changes:
            * `source ~/.bashrc`
        * **Explanation:** This sets the environment variable `TERMINAL` to tell applications to use xterm as the default terminal.
* **Starting the i3 Desktop Environment:**
    * Start the i3 window manager with the following command:
        * `startx`
    * You can exit i3 by pressing Mod+Shift+E (Mod is usually the Windows key).
* **Installing Microsoft Edge Browser:**
    * Install the necessary tools and clone the Microsoft Edge AUR package.
    * Run the following commands:
        * `sudo pacman -S base-devel git`
            * **Explanation:** Installs base development tools and Git.
                * **git** is needed to retrieve the necessary files.
                * **base-devel** is needed to compile those files into an installable package.
        * `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/microsoft-edge-stable-bin.git`
        * `cd microsoft-edge-stable-bin`
        * `makepkg -si`
            * **Explanation:** Builds and installs the Microsoft Edge package from the AUR.
    * Start i3 with `startx` and then start Microsoft Edge by running the command (user have to do this evertime for launching Microsoft Edge):
        * `microsoft-edge-stable`
        * To maximize the window, click on the Microsoft Edge window and press Ctrl+F.
* **Installing NetworkManager Applet (GUI for Network Management):**
    * Install the NetworkManager applet to provide a graphical interface for managing network connections.
    * Run the following command:
        * `sudo pacman -S network-manager-applet`
    * Configure i3 to start the NetworkManager applet on startup.
        * `nano ~/.config/i3/config`
        * Add the following line to the end of the file:
            * `exec --no-startup-id nm-applet`
        * Save and exit.
    * Restart i3 with `startx`.
    * You should now see a network icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. Clicking on it will allow you to manage your network connections using a GUI.
    * If you need to connect to a wifi network via the command line use:
        * `nmcli device wifi connect "YourWifiSSID" password "YourWifiPassword"`
        * or if you need to be prompted for the password.
        * `nmcli device wifi connect "<netwrokName>" --ask`
