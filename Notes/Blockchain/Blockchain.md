## Smart contracts

A smart contract is a decentralized computer program running on a blockchain network that automatically and deterministically executes agreements based on predefined conditions.  
Smart contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.

Bitcoin is intentionally "turning incomplete". It misses a lots of functionality that ethirium has.

The oracle problem:
Blockchains are intentionally walled off. If we want to implement blockchain everywhere we need data from real world. Blockchains are deterministic systems.

Blockchain oracle: Any device that intercats with the off chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts.

We need a decentralized oracle network, similar to our decentralized blockchain network.

We need both our on-chain logic and off-chain data and computations to be decentralized. Combining this gives rise to Hybrid smart contracts: On-chain + Off-chain agreements. Chainlink solves this problem.
ChainLink: Decentralized oracle network

In this course we use smart contrat and hybrid smart contrat interchangeably. The difference is that hybrid smart contrats have some off-chain records. We use smart contract platform and blockchain interchangeably.
Blockchain could means stored value and smart contract platform.

Most blockchains are compatible with ethereum type smart contracts.

Dapp = Decentralized application = decentralized protocol = smart contract protocol

Web1: The permissionless open sourced web with static content.

Web2: The permissioned web, with dynamic content. Where companies run your agreements on their servers.

Web3: The permissions web, with dynamic content. Where decentralized censorship resistant networks runs your agreement and code. It generally is accompanied by the idea of user owned ecosystems, where the protocols you interact with you also own a portion of, instead of solely being the product.

## What is the value of smart contracts?
They do trust minimised agreements meaning they give rise to unbreakable promises.

## What is the purpose of smart contracts?
Relandscape Markets and Agreements

A smart contract is an agreement, contract, or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain. It cannot be altered (immutable), it automatically executes and everyone sees the terms of the agreement.
