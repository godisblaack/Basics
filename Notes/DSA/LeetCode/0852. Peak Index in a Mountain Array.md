**My solution**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int peakIndexInMountainArray(vector<int>& arr) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.size() - 1;
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

        while (start <= end) {
            mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (arr[mid + 1] > arr[mid]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else if (arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]) {
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }

        return mid;
    }
};
```

**Time complexity:** O(log N)

**Space complexity:** O(1)

This is the **optimized** solution.

**Why the algorithm works?**  
The algorithm's strategy is **not** to find the peak, but a peak. Even if there are multiple peaks (like 2 at index 1 and 6 at index 5 in [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]), the algorithm's logic will correctly guide the left and right pointers to converge on one of them. Which one it finds depends on the initial mid calculation and the subsequent comparisons, but it's guaranteed to be a valid peak.
