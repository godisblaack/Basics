**My solution (burte force)**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == '*') {
                s[i] = 0;

                for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                    if (s[j] != 0) {
                        s[j] = 0;
                        
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        string result;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != 0) {
                result += s[i];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

**Time complexity:** O($N^{2}$)  

**Space complexity:** O(N)

This was my brute force approach. On submitting this on LeetCode I got Time Limit Exceeded error. I optimized it using the built in **erase** function of cpp.

**Solution with erase function**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == '*') {
                if (i - 1 >= 0) {
                    s.erase(i - 1, 2);
                    i = i - 2;
                }
            }
        }

        return s;
    }
};
```

**Time complexity:** O($N^{2}$)  

**Space complexity:** O(1)

**Why code with erase function got accepted despite of having same worst case time complexity?**  
Both solutions are theoretically O(N^2) in their absolute worst-case scenarios. However, Code 2 leverages the highly optimized std::string::erase function and avoids the creation of an entirely new string, leading to significantly lower constant factors and often better average-case performance.

When it comes to competitive programming, understanding not just the Big O notation but also the practical implications of constant factors, cache efficiency, and library optimizations is crucial. std::string::erase is generally much more efficient than manual character manipulation and string rebuilding loops for this kind of problem.

After this I saw my previous solution which I submitted couple of months before this and in that solution I have used stack, so I resolved the problem using the stack. On the glimpse to my previous solution I saw that I have used 2 stacks to solve it, I didn't see my approach. I thought that I will write the exact same solution, but I was wrong. My both the solution with stacks are different.

**Stack solution from couple of months back**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        stack<char> originalString;
        stack<char> reverseString;
        
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reverseString.push(s[i]);
        }

        while(!reverseString.empty()) {
            if (reverseString.top() == '*') {
                reverseString.pop();

                if(!originalString.empty()) {
                    originalString.pop();
                }
            } else {
                originalString.push(reverseString.top());
            
                reverseString.pop();
            }
        }

        while(!originalString.empty()) {
            reverseString.push(originalString.top());
            
            originalString.pop();
        }
        
        string finalString = "";

        while(!reverseString.empty()) {
            finalString += reverseString.top();

            reverseString.pop();
        }

        return finalString;
    }
};
```

**Latest stack solution**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        stack<char> originalStringStack;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != '*') {
                originalStringStack.push(s[i]);
            } else {
                if (!originalStringStack.empty()) {
                    originalStringStack.pop();
                }
            }
        }

        stack<char> reversedStringStack;

        while (!originalStringStack.empty()) {
            reversedStringStack.push(originalStringStack.top());

            originalStringStack.pop();
        }

        string result;

        while (!reversedStringStack.empty()) {
            result += reversedStringStack.top();

            reversedStringStack.pop();
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

This is the **optimized** solution. The solutions with **stack** are optimized.

**Clever solution from LeetCode discussion using for loop**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == '*') {
                j--;
            } else {
                s[j] = s[i];
                j++;
            }
        }
        return s.substr(0, j);
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N)  

**Space complexity:** O(1)

**Gemini gave a solution using just string**:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector> // Not strictly necessary for this specific string-as-stack approach, but good for general context

class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        string result; // This string will act as our stack

        for (char c : s) { // Iterate through each character in the input string
            if (c == '*') {
                if (!result.empty()) { // If the string (acting as a stack) is not empty
                    result.pop_back(); // Remove the last character (pop from stack)
                }
            } else {
                result.push_back(c); // Add the character to the end (push to stack)
            }
        }
        return result; // The string itself is already in the correct order
    }
};
```

**What does amortized mean?**  
When we talk about amortized time complexity, we're referring to the average time complexity per operation over a sequence of operations, rather than the worst-case time complexity of a single operation.
