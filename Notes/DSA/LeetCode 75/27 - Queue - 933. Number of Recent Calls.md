**My solution**

```cpp
class RecentCounter {
public:

    queue<int> pings;

    RecentCounter() {
        
    }
    
    int ping(int t) {
        pings.push(t);

        while (pings.front() < t - 3000) {
            pings.pop();
        }

        return pings.size();
    }
};

/**
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RecentCounter* obj = new RecentCounter();
 * int param_1 = obj->ping(t);
 */
 ```

 **Time complexity:** O(N), where for N calls to ping, the total number of push and pop operations will be proportional to N. 

 **Space complexity:** O(N), where N is the maximum number of pings within the given time window.

 This is the **optimized** solution.
